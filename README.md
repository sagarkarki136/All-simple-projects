Brief of the projects:
  

  
1.Zindi Flood prediction:

  - methods used : K fold, Stacking, Out of fold prediction
 
  - models: all boosting models, bagging , Randon forest
 
  - Result: thiswas my first attemt at the compition and i got on to the leader board at rank of 245 of1100(as of april 2020)
 


2.American sign language Classification:

 - modules: Pytorch, PIL, Numpy, Pandas

 - model: Efficient Net B2(large scope for experimentation with better data and other SOTA models and Ensembling)

 - Result: The data used is from kaggle ASL and I got 100% result but this because the test data set has only one image per letter and therefore it was on point for future experimentation i will go for better data along with data augmentation and variation indata ad then have an ensemble of the Sota models for purpose of deployment

3.Mask or non mask clssification:

 - modules: tensorflow, Keras

 - Model: InceptionResnetV2

 - Result : It gives 100% accuracy on the test set and vaidation set. Further seting this up with a face detector (one of my up coming projects) we can use this for real time detection . Thi can be readiy done ven now with opencv's or any other deep learning packages free face detection software clubbed with my model

4.Gun detection:

 - Tech: Darknet


 - Model: YOLOv3 

 - Result: This mode has been trained for 4000 steps and performs preety well. This can be enhanced with more number of training steps and trying out combinations of the batch size and steps . And of course YOLOv4 is out so .....:)try it

5.Emotion Recognintion:

 - Modules : Tensorflow, Keras

 - Models tried: Inception, Resnet

 - Results and further scope: The results rae not that facinating ,58% on test, the data set used is from FER2013 and i suppose it will definetly perform very well onvce i have more data and better augmentations implemented along with obviously Ensemble and hyper parameter tuning of the models(I am more biased towards the efficient nets:) )
